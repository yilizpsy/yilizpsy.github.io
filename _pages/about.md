Hi, I'm Yili. I have been a postdoc working with dr. Lauren Atlas in Section on Affective Neuroscience and Pain, National Institute of Health (NIH) since May 2022.  I am interested in studying the neural processes and mechanisms of pain and other emotional experiences in self and in others, using behavioral measurement, psychophysiological manipulation, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and computational modeling approach.
